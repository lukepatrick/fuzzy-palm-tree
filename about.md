## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and posts from WordPress have been migrated. The site is using a [beautiful theme designed by Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) with minor custom modifications.
